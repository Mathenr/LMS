<h1 class = "orangeyellow"> Hymn </h1>
   Even the stars and the moon<br>
Don't shine quite like we do<br>
Dreamers searchin' for the truth<br>
Go on, read about us in the news<br>
Pretty reckless, pretty wild<br>
Talking shit and we'll just smile<br>
Don't you see these fuckin' crowns?<br>
If you know what I mean, you on the team<br>
<br>
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion<br>
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing<br>
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai<br>
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet<br>
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust<br>
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up<br>
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness<br>
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in<br>
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live<br>
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live<br>
<br>
After all we've been through<br>
No, we won't stand and salute<br>
So we just ride, we just cruise<br>
Livin' like there's nothing left to lose<br>
If we die before we wake<br>
Who we are is no mistake<br>
This is just the way we're made<br>
You know what I mean, you on the team<br>
<br>
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion<br>
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing<br>
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai<br>
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet<br>
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust<br>
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up<br>
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness<br>
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in<br>
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live<br>
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live<br>
<br>
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion<br>
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing<br>
Flying down the highway, yeah, we do it our way<br>
High as outer space, we don't hear what the rest say<br>
<br>
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust<br>
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up<br>
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness<br>
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in<br>
