    You, you got your own opinions<br>
    But baby, I don't even need to hear 'em<br>
    It used to hurt me, used to bring me down<br>
    Do your worst, 'cause nothing's gonna stop me now<br>
    <br>
    Don't let those losers take your magic, baby, yeah<br>
    <br>
    Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it<br>
    Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Do your thing, don't care if we make 'em jealous<br>
    We're the kings, life is just our party palace<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk, just let 'em talk<br>
    <br>
    Do whatever makes you happy<br>
    And screw everything else if you ask me, hey yeah<br>
    'Cause life is short and we only got one shot<br>
    So let's go balls-out, give it everything we got<br>
    <br>
    Don't let those losers take your magic, baby, yeah<br>
    <br>
    Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it<br>
    Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Do your thing, don't care if we make 'em jealous<br>
    We're the kings, life is just our party palace<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk, just let 'em talk<br>
    <br>
    Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk<br>
    Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em<br>
    Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk<br>
    Let them talk<br>
    <br>
    Boys and girls, everybody talks about you<br>
    Loves and hates, they don't really know about you<br>
    I've decided all the haters everywhere can suck my dick<br>
    Un, deux, trois, four<br>
    <br>
    Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it<br>
    Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em<br>
    Woah... just let 'em talk about it<br>

    Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk<br>
    Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em<br>
    Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk<br>
    Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em<br>
    Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk<br>
