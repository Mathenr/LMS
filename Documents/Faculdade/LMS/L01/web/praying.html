&quot;Am I dead? Or is this one of those dreams? Those horrible dreams that seem like they last forever? If I am alive, why? Why? If there is a God or whatever, something, somewhere, why have I been abandoned by everyone and everything I've ever known? I've ever loved? Stranded. What is the lesson? What is the point? God, give me a sign, or I have to give up. I can't do this anymore. Please just let me die. Being alive hurts too much.&quot;
</i></font><br>
<br>
Well, you almost had me fooled<br>
Told me that I was nothing without you<br>
Oh, and after everything you've done<br>
I can thank you for how strong I have become<br>
<br>
'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell<br>
I had to learn how to fight for myself<br>
And we both know all the truth I could tell<br>
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell<br>
<br>
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying<br>
I hope your soul is changing, changing<br>
I hope you find your peace<br>
Falling on your knees, praying<br>
<br>
I'm proud of who I am<br>
No more monsters, I can breathe again<br>
And you said that I was done<br>
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come<br>
<br>
'Cause I can make it on my own<br>
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known<br>
I've been thrown out, I've been burned (<i>[Live version:]</i> I'll bring thunder, I'll bring rain)<br>
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name<br>
<br>
You brought the flames and you put me through hell<br>
I had to learn how to fight for myself<br>
And we both know all the truth I could tell<br>
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell<br>
<br>
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying<br>
I hope your soul is changing, changing<br>
I hope you find your peace<br>
Falling on your knees, praying<br>
<br>
Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night<br>
Oh, someday, maybe you'll see the light<br>
Oh, some say, in life you gonna get what you give<br>
But some things, only God can forgive<br>
<br>
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying<br>
I hope your soul is changing, changing<br>
I hope you find your peace<br>
Falling on your knees, praying
