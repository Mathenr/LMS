<h1 class = "blue"> Hunt You Down </h1>
I wanna be your baby, your angel all in black<br>
Your little blue-eyed gypsy who's always got your back<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh oh<br>
I wanna be your favorite and always by your side<br>
I wanna talk forever with babies down the line<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh oh<br>
<br>
But I got something to tell you first, alright<br>
<br>
I've never hurt nobody, never buried a body<br>
Never killed no one, no, no<br>
I ain't afraid to get a little crazy<br>
Baby, when I'm in love<br>
You say you've had your fun<br>
And that you're done and I'm the one<br>
Just know that if you fuck around<br>
Boy, I'll hunt you down<br>
<br>
I'm like a little kitty and I can see at night<br>
I got eyes like a hawk, babe, I'm watching all the time<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh<br>
Yodel-odel-oh, oh oh oh<br>
<br>
But I got a warning for you first, alright<br>
<br>
I've never hurt nobody, never buried a body<br>
Never killed no one, no, no<br>
I ain't afraid to get a little crazy<br>
Baby, when I'm in love<br>
You say you've had your fun<br>
But that you're done and I'm the one<br>
Just know, that if you fuck around<br>
Boy, I'll hunt you down<br>
<br>
I can't believe it, night after night<br>
Life is so perfect when you walk the line<br>
Baby, I love you so much<br>
Don't make me kill you<br>
<br>
I've never hurt nobody, never buried a body<br>
Never killed no one, no, no<br>
I ain't afraid to get a little crazy<br>
Baby, when I'm in love<br>
You say you've had your fun<br>
But that you're done and I'm the one<br>
Just know, that if you fuck around<br>
Remember, I've never hurt nobody, never buried a body<br>
Never killed no one, no, no<br>
I ain't afraid to get a little crazy<br>
Baby, when I'm in love<br>
You say you've had your fun<br>
But that you're done and I'm the one<br>
Just know, that if you fuck around<br>
Boy, I'll hunt you down<br>
Yeah, boy, I'll hunt you down
