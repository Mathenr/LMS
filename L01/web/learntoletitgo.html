Been a prisoner of the past<br>
Had a bitterness when I looked back<br>
Was telling everyone it's not that bad<br>
'Til all my shit hit the fan<br>
<br>
I know I'm always like<br>
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim<br>
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment<br>
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you<br>
<br>
I think it's time to practice what I preach<br>
Exorcise the demons inside me<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it<br>
Live and learn and never forget it<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
<br>
Had a boogieman under my bed<br>
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head<br>
Always whispering, &quot;It's all your fault&quot;<br>
He was telling me &quot;No, you're not that strong&quot;<br>
<br>
I know I'm always like<br>
Telling everybody you don't have to be a victim<br>
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment<br>
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you<br>
<br>
So I think it's time to practice what I preach<br>
Exorcise the demons inside me<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it<br>
Live and learn and never forget it<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Learn to let go, learn to let go<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Learn to let go, learn to let go<br>
<br>
I'm done reliving my bad decisions<br>
I see now maybe there's a reason<br>
Why, I, I, I, I, I, I been through hell and back<br>
Yeah, honestly, it's what made me who I am<br>
Holding on to wasted time<br>
Gotta learn to let go in life<br>
<br>
So I think it's time to practice what I preach<br>
Exorcise the demons inside me<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it<br>
Live and learn and never forget it<br>
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go<br>
<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Learn to let go, learn to let go<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah<br>
Learn to let go, learn to let go
