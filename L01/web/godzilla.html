What do you get when you take Godzilla to the mall?<br>
He scares all the children and shreds all the pillows<br>
And knocks over walls<br>
His emerald eyes, they sparkle and shine<br>
As he eats the food court and steals half my fries<br>
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to the mall<br>
<br>
What do you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom?<br>
He rings the bell and she looks out the window, and calls the cops<br>
I try to explain that he's mostly tame<br>
As long as there's pizza and video games<br>
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom<br>
<br>
While everyone else is running and screaming<br>
I just love being with you<br>
I guess they don't see all the things that I'm seein'<br>
That make you so uniquely you, you, you, you<br>
<br>
What do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?
