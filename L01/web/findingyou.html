<h1 class = "green"> Finding You </h1>
I wanna lay in your arms when the world is burning<br>
I wanna dig in your heart, take away your hurting<br>
Kiss me and tell me I'm fine and forget we're dying<br>
I wanna feel you tonight like the very first time<br>
Let's run away, baby, drive straight into the moonlight<br>
Kiss me and tell me you're mine like no one's watching<br>
Like time is stopping<br>
<br>
I know forever don't exist<br>
But after this life, I'll find you in the next<br>
So when I say &quot;forever,&quot; it's the goddamn truth<br>
I'll keep finding, finding you<br>
<br>
I'm gonna search for your love, right through Hell and Heaven<br>
Millions of years yet to come and in all dimensions<br>
I know that you'll always be my happy ending, my happy ending<br>
<br>
I know forever don't exist<br>
But after this life, I'll find you in the next<br>
So when I say &quot;forever,&quot; it's the goddamn truth<br>
I'll keep finding, finding you<br>
<br>
Ah ooh... (Finding, finding you)<br>
Ah ooh... (Finding, finding you)<br>
Ah ooh... (Finding, finding you)<br>
Ah ooh... (Finding, finding you)<br>
I'll keep finding, finding you<br>
<br>
I know forever don't exist<br>
After this life, I'll find you in the next<br>
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; it's the goddamn truth<br>
I'll keep finding, finding you<br>
I know forever don't exist<br>
But after this life, I'll find you in the next<br>
And when I say &quot;forever,&quot; it's the goddamn truth<br>
I'll keep finding, finding, finding you<br>
Keep finding, finding you
