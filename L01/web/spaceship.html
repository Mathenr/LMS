I always said when I'm gone, when I'm dead<br>
Don't lay me down with the dirt on my head<br>
You won't need a shovel, you don't need a cold headstone<br>
You don't need to cry, I'm gon' be going home<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me<br>
It's coming back for me<br>
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah<br>
I been living in a lonesome galaxy<br>
But in my dreams, I see them come and rescue me<br>
Look up in the sky and there they'll be<br>
I bet you'll think of me then<br>
You're gonna say, &quot;Ooh, look at that, oh yeah, yeah&quot;<br>
Damn, if it ain't true<br>
They're coming back for me, they're coming back for me, yeah<br>
<br>
I knew from the start I don't belong in these parts<br>
There's too much hate, there's too much hurt for this heart<br>
Lord knows this planet feels like a hopeless place<br>
Thank God I'm going back home to outer space<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me<br>
It's coming back for me<br>
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah<br>
I been living in a lonesome galaxy<br>
But in my dreams, I see them come and rescue me<br>
Look up in the sky and there they'll be<br>
I bet you'll think of me then<br>
You're gonna say, &quot;Ooh, look at that, oh yeah, yeah&quot;<br>
Damn, if it ain't true<br>
They're coming back for me, they're coming back for me, yeah<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back for me<br>

&quot;As I leave this earth and sail into the infinite cosmo of the universe, the wars, the triumphs, the beauty, and the bloodshed, the ocean of human endeavor, it all grows quiet, insignificant. I'm nothing more than recycled stardust and borrowed energy, born from a rock, spinning in the ether. I watch my life backwards and forwards and I feel free. Nothing is real, love is everything, and I know nothing.&quot;
