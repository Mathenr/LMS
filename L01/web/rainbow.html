I used to live in the darkness<br>
Dress in black, act so heartless<br>
But now I see that colors are everything<br>
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo<br>
Got back the stars in my eyes, too<br>
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me<br>
<br>
Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up<br>
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive<br>
Dreaming in light, light, lights<br>
This kitty cat lost her mind<br>
Been looking for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright<br>
Look to the skies<br>
<br>
I've found a rainbow, rainbow, baby<br>
Trust me, I know, life is scary<br>
But just put those colors on, girl<br>
Come and play along with me tonight<br>
<br>
I'd forgot how to daydream<br>
So consumed with the wrong things<br>
But in the dark, I realized this life is short<br>
And deep down, I'm still a child<br>
Playful eyes, wide and wild<br>
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold<br>
<br>
And I know that I'm still fucked up<br>
But aren't we all, my love?<br>
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are<br>
So when the winds are howling strong<br>
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart<br>
<br>
You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby<br>
Trust me, I know life is scary<br>
But just put those colors on, girl<br>
Come and play along with me tonight<br>
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you<br>
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you<br>
But just put those colors on, girl<br>
Come and paint the world with me tonight<br>
Night, night, night, night, night<br>
<br>
I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby<br>
Trust me, I know life is scary<br>
But just put those colors on, girl<br>
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you<br>
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you<br>
But just put those colors on, girl<br>
Come and paint the world with me tonight<br>
Oh, put those colors on, girl<br>
Come and paint the world with me tonight<br>
<br>
Come and paint the world with me tonight
