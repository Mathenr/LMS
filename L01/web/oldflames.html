<h2> Featuring Dolly Parton </h2>
Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who<br>
I use to take comfort from long before I met you<br>
I caught a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire<br>
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire<br>
<br>
But old flames can't hold a candle to you<br>
No one can light up the night like you do<br>
Flickering embers of love<br>
I've known one or two<br>
But old flames can't hold a candle to you<br>
<br>
But sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known<br>
And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone<br>
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone<br>
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn<br>
<br>
But old flames can't hold a candle to you<br>
No one can light up the night like you do<br>
Flickering embers of love<br>
I've known one or two<br>
But old flames can't hold a candle to you<br>
But old flames can't hold a candle to you<br>
Oh, yeah...
