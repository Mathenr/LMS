I have boys in every country code<br>
Just a rollin' stoner on a roll<br>
I'd bring the cowgirl out and cock them guns<br>
Always leave before the cowboy comes<br>
<br>
Then I met you Saturday night, I tried to run away<br>
Sunday morning, I woke up fucked up, with you right next to me<br>
Had a flight booked to Japan, but you took me by the hand<br>
Now every morning I wake up with you right next to me<br>
<br>
I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues<br>
Everything stops when I'm with you<br>
So slide over here, tell me the truth<br>
I know you love me wearing nothing but your boots<br>
<br>
Never thought about that wifey life<br>
Wedding bells just made me wanna die<br>
But when you grab me and you spin me 'round<br>
You really screw my head up upside-down<br>

If you can't handle these claws, you don't get this kitty<br>
Baby, pick me up, spin me 'round, take me on a ride<br>
Pull you by the belt, recognize that you're mine tonight<br>

I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues<br>
Everything stops, ah, when I'm wearing<br>
When I'm wearing, baby, nothing but your boots<br>
<br>
Nothing but your boots...
