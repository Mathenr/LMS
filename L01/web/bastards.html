        One, two, three, four, one...<br>
        <br>
        I got too many people<br>
        I got left to prove wrong<br>
        All those motherfuckers<br>
        Been too mean for too long<br>
        And I'm so sick of crying, yeah<br>
        Darling, what's it for?<br>
        I could fight forever, oh<br>
        But life's too short<br>
        <br>
        Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no<br>
        Don't let the assholes wear you out<br>
        Don't let the mean girls take the crown<br>
        Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round<br>
        Don't let the bastards take you down<br>
        <br>
        Been underestimated<br>
        My entire life<br>
        I know people gonna talk shit<br>
        And darling, that's fine<br>
        But they won't break my spirit<br>
        I won't let 'em win<br>
        I'll just keep on living, keep on living, oh<br>
        The way I wanna live<br>
        <br>
        Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no<br>
        Don't let the assholes wear you out<br>
        Don't let the mean girls take the crown<br>
        Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round<br>
        Don't let the bastards take you down<br>
        Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no<br>
        Don't let the assholes wear you out<br>
        Don't let the mean girls take the crown<br>
        Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round<br>
        Don't let the bastards take you down<br>
        <br>
        Na na na...<br>
        <br>
